# Piracy-Preservation-System

The Piracy Preservation System is designed to enhance user privacy protection in trajectory data release. The system leverages a dummy trajectory generation algorithm to obscure start- and end-points, preventing attackers with background knowledge from tracking user movements. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a trusted third party, this approach ensures k-anonymity by generating multiple plausible paths, making it difficult to distinguish real user trajectories.

# Features:
Secure Start & End Points: Prevents unauthorized tracking by generating protected trajectory points.
Dummy Trajectory Generation: Creates k-1 alternative paths to maintain user anonymity.
Reduced Data Loss: Ensures minimal information distortion while safeguarding privacy.
Scalable & Efficient: Optimized for real-world implementation with minimal computational overhead.
